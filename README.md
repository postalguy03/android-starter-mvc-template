# android-mvc-template

This template was created to help make the transition from web development to native android development as painless as possible.  
At the end of the day these should go hand in hand if your app is designed to consume external content.

My goal is to have anyone download this project, use the samples to learn and within a few minutes start writing code
relative to their app rather than spending days setting up their projects with the proper libraries & dependancies in a way 
that can support good/structured development
